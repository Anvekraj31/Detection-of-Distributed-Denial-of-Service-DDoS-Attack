# Detection-of-Distributed-Denial-of-Service-DDoS-Attack

The DDoS Attack Detection System leverages machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks with high accuracy. Using the Random Forest algorithm, the system analyzes network traffic features to detect malicious activity and ensure robust network security. The model is trained on large datasets, achieving 99.99% accuracy, making it a reliable solution for real-time attack detection and prevention.

# Features:
High Accuracy Detection: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to identify DDoS attacks effectively.
Traffic Analysis: Processes network packets to differentiate between legitimate and malicious requests.
Scalability & Performance: Handles large datasets efficiently without compromising detection speed.
Future Enhancements: Potential improvements include real-time monitoring, integration with advanced AI models, and fine-tuning to detect evolving attack patterns.
